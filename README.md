# sqlalchemy-challenge
This project analyzes measurements of precipitation and temperatures over time across multiple weather stations. It utilizes two CSV files and a SQLite database file to store and manage the data. The main component of the project is an the climate_starter and app.py files that interacts with the SQLite database to extract key statistics on specific stations during certain time periods.

The app.py file provides users with the ability to input their desired start and end dates, allowing them to view summary statistics for the chosen time span. Additionally, the application offers access to a variety of statistical analyses originally implemented in the climate_starter file.

My name is Jack Maxwell, and I completed this project with the invaluable assistance of the askBCS tutors. The following links were also instrumental in guiding my progress:
